- Keep preprocessing reproducible and validated.

## Materials

- Use /data/raw, /data/intermediate, /data/processed for datasets and outputs
- Environment/setup notes live in /environment

## Readings
- Alsarra et al. (2025) Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory
- Burnham et al. (2025) Political Analysis
