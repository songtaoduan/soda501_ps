# Experiments

**Theme:** Quantum Computing for Social Data (Intro)


## Goals
- Understand core experimental concepts: potential outcomes, random assignment, compliance, and interference.
- Design and diagnose experiments (power, balance, attrition, noncompliance).
- Estimate treatment effects (ATE, ITT, TOT) and interpret results clearly.
- Connect experiments to common social-science data tasks (field experiments, survey experiments, online experiments).
